Shepherd's store now records who wrote a run's code. A new `shepherd_lineage` table, added by its own migration (version 5, after the registration table's version 4), holds one row per run and agent: name, role (`implementer` or `successor`), the predecessor a successor took over from, and when it was recorded. `ShepherdStore.recordAuthor(runId, agent)` is idempotent on run and agent id and keeps the first row on a repeat. `authorsOf(runId)` returns that run's authors in a stable order. Existing databases keep every registration when they gain the table. Nothing calls it yet.
