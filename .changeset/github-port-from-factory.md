"@titan-design/github": minor
"@titan-design/factory": patch
---

Add `@titan-design/github`: the factory's GitHub REST port (`githubPort`, `ghCliWire`, `evaluateChecks`, `latestPerName`, argument validation and the `fakeGitHub` test wire), moved unchanged with its tests. The factory now depends on it and deletes `src/github/`; its root no longer re-exports the GitHub types and functions, so import them from `@titan-design/github`.
