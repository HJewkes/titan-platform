"@titan-design/egress-scan": minor
---

Add the `titan-egress-scan` bin: `pre-push`, `range`, `tree` and `install-hook` commands, per-commit scanning with `git show -c` so merge commits are covered, the private term list lookup (skipped in CI, a notice when absent, exit 2 under `TITAN_EGRESS_REQUIRE_TERMS=1`), and a shipped POSIX pre-push hook that fails closed when the scanner is not installed.
