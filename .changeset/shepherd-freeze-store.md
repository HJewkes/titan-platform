Shepherd keeps a per-repo freeze in the factory database (`shepherd_freeze`, migration 6) and the merge guard refuses every PR of a frozen repo except the one registered to the freeze's fix task. A blocked merge re-reads the default branch at most every five minutes and lifts the freeze when its head, other than the red sha, has all-green Actions runs. The merge evidence step now reads `isFrozen` from that store by default.
