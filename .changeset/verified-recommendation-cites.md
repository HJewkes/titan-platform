Check a recommendation's cite against its transcript when the deposit is filed.

- `@titan-design/evidence`: `quoteInText(text, quote)` matches a quote against any text. It normalises whitespace and line wrapping the same way `quoteInRange` does, and `quoteInRange` now calls it.
- `@titan-design/owner-queue`: `recommended.cite` takes legacy free text or a strict `{session, event, quote}`, where `event` is `<byteOffset>:<byteLength>` of one transcript line (`locatorCiteSchema`, `LocatorCite`). A consumer that read `cite` as a string must now handle the object form too. `writeDeposit(dir, deposit, { events })` throws `DepositCiteError` and writes nothing for a locator cite whose quote does not match the event text, an event that cannot be read, an empty quote, or a call with no `events` source. Free text is never checked.
- `@titan-design/session-read`: `readSessionEventText({session, byteOffset, byteLength}, { roots })` returns the message text of one whole Claude transcript line. It returns null when the session is not in exactly one transcript or the span is not one whole line.
- `titan-console`: `inbox.deposit` checks locator cites through session-read and answers 400 when the check fails.
