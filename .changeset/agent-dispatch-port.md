"@titan-design/agent-dispatch": minor
---

Add `@titan-design/agent-dispatch`, ported unchanged from relay's daemon: `dispatchToAgentChat` and `buildSpawnArgs` (brief on stdin under `--brief-stdin`), `resumeArgs`, and `execSafe`, `minimalEnv` and `resolveBinaryPath`. The one API change from relay: the profile allowlist is the caller's third argument instead of relay's two profile constants.
