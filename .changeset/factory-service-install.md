Add `titan-factory service install [--port <n>] [--node <path>] [--mcp]`, `uninstall`, `status` and `restart`. Install boots out a loaded job, writes the LaunchAgent plist, bootstraps it and waits for `/health` from launchd's own process, exiting 1 with the tail of `serve.err.log` when it never answers; `--mcp` registers the MCP endpoint with `claude` and never fails the install. `status` exits 0 only when `/health` answers. Each verb fails with one line off macOS; `service plist` is unchanged. The root script `pnpm factory:install` installs, builds factory with its workspace deps and links `~/.local/bin/titan-factory` to the built bin.
