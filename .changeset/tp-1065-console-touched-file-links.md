"titan-console": patch

`sessions.timeline` now returns `touchedFiles`: one entry per distinct touched path, with `{touchPath, ref, repo, path, nodeId, href}`. A path inside a repo maps to its repo-relative posix path, which is the code-graph file id, with any leaked `.worktrees/<name>/` prefix stripped, and links to `<codewatch address>#/node/<encodeURIComponent(id)>`. A path outside any repo keeps null `nodeId` and `href` and renders as plain text. The address comes from `TITAN_CONSOLE_CODEWATCH_URL`, by default `http://127.0.0.1:7433`. The index is not checked, so an id codewatch lacks lands on its not-found page.
