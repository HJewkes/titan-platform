Add the `shepherd.register`, `status`, `list`, `timeline`, `hold`, `release` and `merge` registry commands, served by `titan-factory serve` as MCP tools `shepherd__<cmd>` and `/rpc/shepherd.<cmd>`, and as `titan-factory shepherd <cmd>`. `register` refuses a denied repo before starting anything and is idempotent on `repo#pr` and on the PR's head branch. `merge` evaluates the policy and resolves no gate; gate resolution stays CLI-only. `list` and `timeline` return the `WatchRow` and `PrTimeline` shapes exported from `shepherd/view.ts`.
