Land and Shepherd's merge-facts collection fail closed when a repo's required checks cannot be read. A port error, a 403 (rulesets dropped on a private repo on GitHub Free) or a 404 stops land and gates the merge with a reason naming the repo and the HTTP status, instead of being read as "no required checks". A successful empty read behaves as before.
