Add Shepherd seat policy: `shepherd/seats.ts` reads autonomy-seat/v1 seat files and the charter's hard stops, and `shepherd/policy.ts` resolves the effective per-PR policy as the seat default narrowed by the registration, refusing denied repos. `shepherdGatePolicy` maps it to a `GatePolicy`. Config gains `shepherd.seatsDir` and `shepherd.charterPath`.
