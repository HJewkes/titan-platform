The daemon's guards now refuse a state-changing request (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, including `/rpc/:name` and `/mcp`) that carries neither an `Origin` header nor a non-empty `X-Titan-Client` header, with a 403. Before, a missing `Origin` skipped the origin check. Non-browser callers must add `x-titan-client: <name>`; `CLIENT_HEADER` is exported from `@titan-design/rpc-protocol` and re-exported by `@titan-design/daemon`, and `liveSource` in `@titan-design/rpc-client` now sends it. `GuardedRequest` gains a `client` field (TP-238).
