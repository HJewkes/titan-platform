Add `titan-factory service plist`, which prints the `dev.hjewkes.titan-factory` LaunchAgent plist (`ProcessType` Interactive, `KeepAlive` and `RunAtLoad` true, logs under the XDG state directory). `titan-factory serve` health gains a `github` field: `ok`, or the redacted error from `gh api rate_limit`, probed in the background at most once a minute with a 10 s timeout.
