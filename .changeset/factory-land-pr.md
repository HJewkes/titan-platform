Register the `land-pr` workflow: a snapshot of the PR, `land` rounds, one code-owned rerun when every failing check was cancelled or timed out, and otherwise a `ci-failed` gate (`rerun`, `abandon` or `await-fix`, bound to the red head). Add `awaitNewHead` and `awaitNewHeadRoute`, which block until a PR shows a head other than the red one.
