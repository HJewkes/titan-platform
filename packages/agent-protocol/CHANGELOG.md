# @titan-design/agent-protocol

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 25391fa: Add durable execution transitions and a transactional, lease-fenced execution ledger. Persist workflow dispatch identities and acknowledgments before waiting, and retain uncertain executions for explicit recovery rather than silently redispatching after restart.
- 3bde552: Add opt-in harness-neutral identity, usage, execution preflight and normalized session
  contracts for Claude/Codex integration. Existing Claude execution and transcript APIs
  retain their behavior. Codex execution, decoding and graph migration follow separately.
