# @titan-design/session-read

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0bdae32]
  - @titan-design/locator@0.2.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fc7b58e: Derive task status from transcript content. `parseTaskIntents` reads every
  `active-work`/`aw` task invocation in a compound command, not just one anchored at the
  start of the line, and reports the status the `done` and explicit `edit … status` forms
  state. Task events carry that status, the folder lets a closing mention upgrade an earlier
  read, and the graph writes it with a COALESCE that a later bare mention cannot erase.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d33d861: Extract Claude Code transcript reading from active-work's session miner as a storage-free
  event stream: `LineReader` (stateless per line, byte-offset locators), the `SessionEvent`
  union, `EventFolder` with chunk-boundary-safe merge rules, `readTranscriptEvents` /
  `extractTranscript` with prefix-hash resume, bash intent parsing, repo attribution, and
  transcript discovery including subagent sidechains. `session-graph` is stamped as a placeholder.
