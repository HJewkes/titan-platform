# @titan-design/session-read

### Minor Changes

- d33d861: Extract Claude Code transcript reading from active-work's session miner as a storage-free
  event stream: `LineReader` (stateless per line, byte-offset locators), the `SessionEvent`
  union, `EventFolder` with chunk-boundary-safe merge rules, `readTranscriptEvents` /
  `extractTranscript` with prefix-hash resume, bash intent parsing, repo attribution, and
  transcript discovery including subagent sidechains. `session-graph` is stamped as a placeholder.
