# @titan-design/session-read

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 11b94a2: Add bounded Codex execution, rollout discovery/decoding, and opt-in mixed-harness
  session ingestion with format-aware search excerpts and error readback. Preserve
  legacy Claude rows and references through additive conversation aliases. Prevent
  orphaned contentless FTS row IDs from leaking stale terms after source replacement.
  Recognize native shell missing-file diagnostics in error clustering.
- 81b60ee: Add graph-free Claude/Codex observation dispatch, source lookup, bounded recent-turn reads and session summaries. Share usage folding with graph queries and preserve native denial evidence separately from generic tool errors.
- 3bde552: Add opt-in harness-neutral identity, usage, execution preflight and normalized session
  contracts for Claude/Codex integration. Existing Claude execution and transcript APIs
  retain their behavior. Codex execution, decoding and graph migration follow separately.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0bdae32]
  - @titan-design/locator@0.2.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fc7b58e: Derive task status from transcript content. `parseTaskIntents` reads every
  `active-work`/`aw` task invocation in a compound command, not just one anchored at the
  start of the line, and reports the status the `done` and explicit `edit … status` forms
  state. Task events carry that status, the folder lets a closing mention upgrade an earlier
  read, and the graph writes it with a COALESCE that a later bare mention cannot erase.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d33d861: Extract Claude Code transcript reading from active-work's session miner as a storage-free
  event stream: `LineReader` (stateless per line, byte-offset locators), the `SessionEvent`
  union, `EventFolder` with chunk-boundary-safe merge rules, `readTranscriptEvents` /
  `extractTranscript` with prefix-hash resume, bash intent parsing, repo attribution, and
  transcript discovery including subagent sidechains. `session-graph` is stamped as a placeholder.
